# My-Udacity-Bikeshare-Project
My first project and I'm proud of it because it taught me more techniques and how to analyze my data with Python because the right decisions are always more solid and robust when based on a realistic scenario.

Introduction

This Python script is written for Project 2 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from CSV files and computes descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
